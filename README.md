## App Pages

### Home Page
The **Home** page provides an overview of the applicationâ€™s purpose, focusing on car price prediction and data analysis.

### Prediction
The **Prediction** page enables users to predict car prices by inputting various car attributes such as:

- Car age
- Kilometers driven
- Number of seats
- Maximum power
- Mileage
- Engine capacity

It uses a pre-trained Random Forest Regressor model to predict the car price based on the input values.

### Data Analysis
The **Data Analysis** page allows users to visualize the dataset. It includes:

- **Bar Charts**: For categorical variables like car brand, fuel type, seller type, etc.
- **Histograms**: For continuous variables like selling price and kilometers driven.
- **Correlation Heatmap**: For understanding relationships between different numeric features.

### Model Comparison
The **Model Comparison** page presents a comparison table of various models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting) with their performance metrics (RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² score). 

This section also includes:
- A **scatter plot** of predicted vs. actual values for Random Forest.
- A **feature importance plot** for the Random Forest model.
- A **loss function plot** for Gradient Boosting.

### Contact
The **Contact** page provides links to the creator's social profiles and email for feedback or inquiries.

## Helper Functions

### `load_data()`
Loads and preprocesses the car dataset, including encoding categorical features and computing car age.

### `train_random_forest_model()`
Trains a Random Forest model on the preprocessed data.

### `plot_bar_chart()`
Plots bar charts for categorical columns to visualize their distribution.

### `plot_histogram()`
Plots histograms for numerical columns to show data distribution.

### `plot_correlation_heatmap()`
Displays a heatmap of feature correlations within the dataset.

### `plot_rf_scatter()`
Plots predicted vs. actual values for the Random Forest model on the test data.

### `plot_feature_importance()`
Plots feature importance values for the Random Forest model.

### `plot_gbm_loss()`
Shows a loss function plot for the Gradient Boosting model to illustrate model training over the number of trees.

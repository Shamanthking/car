## App Pages

### Home Page
The **Home** page introduces the purpose of the application, focusing on car price prediction and data analysis.

### Prediction
The **Prediction** page allows users to predict car prices by entering car attributes such as:

- Car age
- Kilometers driven
- Number of seats
- Maximum power
- Mileage
- Engine capacity

It leverages a pre-trained Random Forest Regressor model to provide an estimated selling price based on the userâ€™s inputs.

### Data Analysis
The **Data Analysis** page lets users visualize the dataset through various charts:

- **Bar Charts** for categorical features like car brand, fuel type, seller type, etc.
- **Histograms** for continuous features like selling price and kilometers driven.
- **Correlation Heatmap** to explore relationships between numeric features.

### Model Comparison
The **Model Comparison** page provides a performance comparison of different models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) using key metrics:

- **RMSE**, **MAE**, and **RÂ² score**
- **Scatter plot** of predicted vs. actual values for the Random Forest model
- **Feature importance plot** for Random Forest
- **Loss function plot** for Gradient Boosting

### Contact
The **Contact** page includes links to the creator's social profiles and an email option for feedback or inquiries.

## Helper Functions

### `load_data()`
Loads and preprocesses the car dataset, including encoding categorical features and calculating car age.

### `train_random_forest_model()`
Trains a Random Forest model on the preprocessed data.

### `plot_bar_chart()`
Creates bar charts for categorical columns to visualize distributions.

### `plot_histogram()`
Creates histograms for numeric columns to show data distributions.

### `plot_correlation_heatmap()`
Displays a heatmap of feature correlations within the dataset.

### `plot_rf_scatter()`
Plots predicted vs. actual values for the Random Forest model on test data.

### `plot_feature_importance()`
Displays feature importance for the Random Forest model.

### `plot_gbm_loss()`
Shows the loss function for Gradient Boosting to illustrate model performance over iterations.
